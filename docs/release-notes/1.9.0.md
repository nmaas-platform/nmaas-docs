Date: 2026/01/28

## General

[nmaas 1.9.0](https://gitlab.software.geant.org/nmaas/nmaas-platform/-/releases/v1.9.0) is a milestone release including many features supporting or enhancing functionalities added in previous releases.

## New Features

### Webhooks execution history

History of executed webbooks along with their payload and response status is now persisted and can be displayed in the Portal. This allows for easier troubleshooting when interacting with remote systems.

### Domain limits

Administrators can define resource quotas globally and on a per-domain basis to enforce limits on CPU and memory usage as well as to control the total number of deployed containers. The application specification file has been extended to support this extra information.

### Support for shared GitLab instance

It is now possible for an already existing, shared, instance of GitLab to be used by nmaas so that all application instance repositories are created within a dedicated top-level GitLab group. This removes the need for a dedicated GitLab deployment alongside nmaas.

### Helm charts from OCI registries

Added support for deploying Helm charts hosted on OCI registries.

### Default domain assignment for new SSO logins

Administrator may now configure nmaas to have all new SSO users automatically assigned a user role in a selected domain. 

## Enhancements

### Improved option for providing remote cluster kubeConfig

Instead of providing kubeConfig file content via the nmaas Portal web UI, administrators are now able to point to a Kubernetes Secret object in the central cluster containing configuration of the remote cluster being onboarded. This allows nmaas to work alongside other cloud native tools facilitating multi-cluster support such as [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/kustomize/kustomizations/#kubeconfig-remote-clusters).

### Improved handling of Helm command execution response

A Helm install command execution warning is no longer considered as application installation failure.

### Option to limit number of returned lines during log viewing

Running application instance log viewing panel was enhanced with an option to limit the number of displayed log lines to improve performance and readability.
