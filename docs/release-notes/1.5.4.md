# 1.5.4

## General

[nmaas 1.5.4](https://github.com/nmaas-platform/nmaas-platform/releases/tag/v1.5.4) is a minor update containing one new feature, asynchronous Helm repository updates.

### Automatic Helm Repository Updates in the Background

Until now, the nmaas Platform was executing the `helm repo update` command via the `nmaas-helm` component prior to each application instance deployment. This slowed down the deployment process in cases of unresponsive Helm repositories or a large number of repositories that need to be refreshed. The nmaas Platform now exposes two additional configuration properties (configured from Helm chart) controlling this behavior: `platform.properties.helm.asyncUpdateEnabled` and `platform.properties.helm.asyncUpdateCron`. The latter accepts a cron-style expression for scheduling when `helm repo update` should be run in case `asyncUpdateEnabled` is set to `true`. A `helm repo update` is unconditionally run upon each new application version addition and during `nmaas-platform` startup.
