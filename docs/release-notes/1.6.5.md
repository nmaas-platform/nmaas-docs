# 1.6.5

## General

[nmaas 1.6.5](https://gitlab.software.geant.org/nmaas/nmaas-platform/-/releases/v1.6.5) is a minor release containing 
mainly the reworked bulk application deployment mechanism ensuring increased resiliency and user control.

- Bulk deployment process is now based on a queue and scheduled job which ensures better control over the process and allows for setting custom limit for a number of application instances deployed at once.
- Application instance ready email is no longer sent after application instance upgrade.
- Added dedicated REST endpoint for initialization scripts to indicate that database population with data is in progress.
- On the application instances view replaced the dropdown `my`/`all` with a toggle set to `all` by default.
