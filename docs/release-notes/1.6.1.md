# 1.6.1

## General

[nmaas 1.6.1](https://gitlab.software.geant.org/nmaas/nmaas-platform/-/releases/v1.6.1) is a minor update containing foremost a fix in the nmaas Janitor component along with a set of UI enhancements and new option for application instance deployment customization.

### New Deployment Variables for Applications

Additional global deployment variables were added and can be used by application managers to configure automatic outbound email configuration for instances of a particular application. These variables are:

- `SMTP_HOSTNAME_WITH_PORT` = this is a new variable that is a concatenation of the existing `{{ SMTP_HOSTNAME }}:{{ SMTP_PORT }}`variables.
- `SMTP_FROM_DEFAULT_DOMAIN` = the default domain for sending emails, e.g. `example.com` 

It is now also possible to specify the PostgreSQL port, in case an external instance is being used, by setting the `POSTGRESQL_PORT` env variable (`.platform.properties.postgresql.port`).

### Portal enhancements

Some enhancements to the UI were identified after the v1.6.0 release mostly focused on user experience and data presentation.
