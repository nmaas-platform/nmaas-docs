# 1.7.1

## General

[nmaas 1.7.1](https://gitlab.software.geant.org/nmaas/nmaas-platform/-/releases/v1.7.1) is a minor release containing 
mainly enhancements to the JWT creation mechanism and improvements in user roles handling.

- The size of the issued Json Web Tokens was reduced by not including user role entries per domain. Currently, JWT carries information only about user role names and role to domain mapping is retrieved by calling a dedicated REST API endpoint.
- Removal of group manager role is now correctly processed and triggers removal of related group domain admin roles in particular domains.
- Some obsolete API calls triggered by the Portal were removed.
