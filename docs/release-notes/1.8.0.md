### Application deployment on remote clusters

Users are given an option during application deployment to select either the central cluster or any of the remote clusters assigned to their domain as target locations for their instance.

### Webhooks support

Administrators can now define remote endpoints that should be notified once one of the supported actions takes place in the Platform.

### Application instance pausing support

Platform exposes new API endpoints for application instance scaling, allowing for pausing of idle applications and thus preserving cluster resources.

## Enhancements

### Brand new Portal layout

Introduced new overall layout of the Portal based on a brand-new design.

### Removed nmaas Janitor component

Operations performed by the Janitor component have been rewritten within the Platform to ease further maintenance of the software.

### Local Helm client

Simplified nmaas deployment architecture by incorporating Helm client in the Platform container, thus removing the necessity to run Helm commands over SSH.

### More advanced readiness checks for applications

Application instance readiness check process now waits for all relevant deployments and statefulsets to become ready before updating the state of the entire instance.

### Upgrade of Java and major dependencies

Platform now runs on Java 21 and all other dependencies were bumped to recent versions.

## Bug Fixes

### Enabled missing email notification

Administrators are now notified with an email about any new application version that requires activation.
