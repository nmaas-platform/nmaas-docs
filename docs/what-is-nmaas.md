# What is **nmaas**?

The nmaas platform is an [open source](https://gitlab.software.geant.org/nmaas) framework originally developed within the [GÉANT](https://geant.org/projects/) project for orchestration of on-demand deployment of applications in a Kubernetes-based cloud environment.

With a simple self-service web interface, nmaas applications are easily deployed within an isolated tenant environment assigned to a given institution or team. An application’s lifecycle (configuration updates and re-deployments) is fully managed following a GitOps approach: a specific Git repository is tightly associated with every deployed application and a set of CI/CD pipelines ensure proper re-deployments of the applications following every update on the Git master branch, ensuring consistent configuration.
