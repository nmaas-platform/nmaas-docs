# 1.5.4

## General

1.5.4 is a minor update containing one new feature, asynchronous Helm repository updates.

### Automatic Helm Repository Updates in the Background

Until now, the nmaas Platform was executing the `helm repo update` command via the `nmaas-helm` component upon each application deployment. This slowed down the application instance deployment in cases of unresponsive Helm repositories or a large number of repositories that need to be refreshed. The nmaas chart, and by extension the nmaas Platform now exposes two additional configuration properties controlling this behavior: `platform.properties.helm.asyncUpdateEnabled` and `platform.properties.helm.asyncUpdateCron`. The latter accepts a cron-style expression for scheduling when `helm repo update` should be run in case `asyncUpdateEnabled ` is set to `true`. A `helm repo update` is unconditionally run upon each new application version addition and `nmaas-platform` startup.
