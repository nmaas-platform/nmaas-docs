# nmaas Tutorials and Workshops

This section contains the materials for tutorials and workshops where the nmaas Platform or one of its use-cases has been presented. Currently it includes the archived resources for the following events:

- [JRES 2022 - GÉANT Network Management as a Service tutorial](jres2022/introduction.md)
- [JRES 2024 - Orchestrated Deployment of Virtual Labs for Education](jres2024/introduction.md)

To fully leverage the content in these materials, access to an nmaas test instance is advised. This can be accomplish by:

- deploying a [local Kubernetes cluster](./deploying-local-kubernetes-cluster.md) and then [deploying an nmaas test instance in it](./deploying-nmaas-test-instance.md).
- registering for an account on the [managed vNOC Playground instance](https://nmaas.geant.org) or the [managed vLAB instance](https://vlab.dev.nmaas.eu), depending on the use-case that you are interested in.
- downloading the ready-made all-in-one nmaas test VM image. Please note that this VM image does not have a `LoadBalancer` implementation installed and it is up to the user to install and configure one. More details about the all-in-one nmaas image are available on the [corresponding docs page](./all-in-one-vm-image.md).
