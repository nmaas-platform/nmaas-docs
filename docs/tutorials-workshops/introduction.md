# nmaas Tutorials and Workshops

This section contains the materials for tutorials and workshops where the nmaas Platform or one of its use-cases has been presented. Currently it includes the archived resources for the following events:

- [JRES 2022 - GÉANT Network Management as a Service tutorial](jres2022/introduction.md)
- [JRES 2024 - Orchestrated Deployment of Virtual Labs for Education](jres2024/introduction.md)

To fully leverage the content in these materials, access to an nmaas test instance is advised. This can be accomplish by:

- deploying a local Kubernetes cluster and then deploying an nmaas test instance in it.
- registering for an account on the [managed vNOC Playground instance](https://nmaas.geant.org) or the [managed vLAB instance](https://vlab.dev.nmaas.eu), depending on the use-case that you are interested in.
