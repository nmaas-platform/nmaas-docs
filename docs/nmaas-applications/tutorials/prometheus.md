### Additional tab

- `Retention data size` ***[Optional]*** - The size of storage space up to which the monitoring data should be retained (default value is displayed in the placeholder, in this case 18 Gigabytes), e.g. `18GB`, `25GB` or `30GB`.
- `Retention period` ***[Optional]*** - The time period for which the monitoring data should be retained (default value is displayed in the placeholder, in this case 15 days), e.g. `15d`, `25d` or `35d`.

The value of `Retention data size` should be kept lower than the value of [requested Storage space](./prometheus.md#advanced-tab).

### Advanced tab

- `Storage space (GB)` ***[Optional]*** - Amount of storage to be allocated to persist data generated by this Prometheus instance (default value is displayed in the placeholder, in this case 20 Gigabytes), e.g. `10`, `20` or `30`.

Prometheus allows for updating the configuration of an already running instance. A configuration update wizard is launched by the Update button available on the application instance details page.
